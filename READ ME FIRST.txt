Client Report (PDF file) contains a summary of the work done for implementing the project.

Strathclyde Project_Socrates (PowerBI file) includes all filters applied on the original given file Strathclyde Project (for creation of new columns with the game outcome (Win/Draw/Loss) at table All Fixtures, filter specific games, etc) and the R-scripts produced for the creation, training, prediction and update of the machine learning model. If someone wishes to run the scripts, he/she has to select the R-visual from the correspondent page (Page 2 for training and Page 3 for update and prediction).

Note: Due to the signature of a confidential agreement between the Scottish Rugby Union and myself, I could not fetch the original dataset. However, I may upload a dummy dataset in the future for experimental purposes.
